# Amazon Q Directives for SoulCoreLegacy Project

## Project Overview
SoulCoreLegacy is an arcade game collection built with Python and Pygame/Pyglet. The project aims to implement classic and original games with a consistent interface and modern design.

## Current Games
1. Pong - Working but needs UI improvements
2. Snake - Not working properly, needs fixes
3. Tic-Tac-Toe - Working correctly
4. Photon Racer - Working correctly
5. NFT Artisan - Not working properly, needs fixes

## Current Task
Implementing an Asteroids clone game using Pyglet based on the tutorial example. This will be a new addition to the SoulCoreLegacy arcade.

## Implementation Requirements
1. Follow the Pyglet tutorial structure for the Asteroids game
2. Ensure proper collision detection and response
3. Implement player controls, shooting mechanics, and asteroid splitting
4. Integrate with the existing SoulCoreLegacy framework
5. Ensure the game is fully playable and bug-free

## Code Structure Guidelines
1. Maintain modular design with separate files for different components
2. Follow Python best practices and PEP 8 style guidelines
3. Add appropriate comments and documentation
4. Implement error handling to prevent crashes

## Integration Notes
The new Asteroids game should be integrated into the SoulCoreLegacy arcade system, accessible from the main menu alongside the other games.

## Testing Requirements
Test all game mechanics thoroughly:
- Player movement and rotation
- Shooting mechanics
- Collision detection
- Asteroid splitting
- Game over conditions
- Score tracking

## Future Considerations
After implementing the basic Asteroids game, consider adding:
- Particle effects for explosions
- Sound effects
- Difficulty levels
- High score tracking
