# Snake Game Fix Report

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Class Name Inconsistency in Game Manager**:
   - The game manager was looking for capitalized game class names (e.g., `SnakeGame`) but using a generic pattern that didn't match all games
   - Fixed by adding explicit class name mappings for each game in the game manager

2. **Analytics Service Access Errors**:
   - The Snake game was trying to access `analytics_service` without checking if it exists
   - Fixed by adding proper attribute checks: `if hasattr(self, 'analytics_service') and self.analytics_service`

3. **Error Handling for Storage Operations**:
   - Added try-except blocks around storage operations to prevent crashes when storage services are unavailable
   - Added error messages to help diagnose issues

## Testing Results

The Snake game is now fully functional:
- Game initializes correctly
- Snake movement responds to arrow key controls
- Food generation and collision detection work properly
- Score tracking functions correctly
- Game over detection works when snake collides with itself
- Wrap-around mode toggle (W key) works correctly

## Additional Improvements

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Added robust error handling for all cloud service interactions
   - Added informative error messages for debugging

2. **Class Name Standardization**:
   - Updated the game manager to handle different class naming conventions
   - This fix also benefits other games with non-standard class names

## Conclusion

The Snake game is now fully playable. The fixes implemented address the core issues that were preventing the game from functioning properly. The game now handles errors gracefully and provides a smooth gameplay experience.

These fixes also improve the overall stability of the arcade by adding better error handling and making the game manager more robust when dealing with different class naming conventions.
